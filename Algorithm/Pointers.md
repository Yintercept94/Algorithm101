# Pointers 

## Introduction

A pointer is something that points to a place in your computer's memory. A pointer is defined as a derived data type that can store the address of other variables or a memory location. We can access and manipulate the data stored in that memory location using pointers. 

## Common Applications

-Index of an array. 
-In binary sort, we usually have two pointers, one at the start and one at the end 
-Searching through an array through binary search works in a similar way as binary sort.
